Unified AI Command Centre – Project Brief 1. Objective Build a centralized AI‑driven communication system that manages all WhatsApp (text and voice) and email communication for GharPey. The system must intelligently understand and respond to replies from users (employers and maids) in Kannada, Hindi, Nepali, and English. Context: You are leading the Tech and Communications division of a Silicon Valley–grade company, GharPey. Your mission is to build the world’s first Unified AI Command Centre capable of autonomously managing communication for millions using voice/text understanding, workflow intelligence, and automated decisionmaking. 2.

Expanded Project Description: Omni‑Channel Communication Hub with Intelligent Replies This system consolidates all communication into one unified interface. 1. Core Problem to Solve - Send notifications such as welcome messages, onboarding prompts, salary reminders, UPI/document reminders. - Handle two‑way WhatsApp conversations (text or voice), understanding and responding intelligently. - Operate in Kannada, Hindi, Nepali, and English with TTS (outgoing) and ASR (incoming). 2. Major Components A. Admin Notification Dashboard (Web UI) - Send WhatsApp text, WhatsApp voice, or email - Choose user segments (e.g., “salary due soon”) - Select message templates (welcome, onboarding, payment reminders) - Define flows: welcome flow, follow‑up flow, salary reminder flow, document missing flow - View user conversations, last reply, workflow stage, delivery metrics - Manage multi‑language templates with variables such as {name}, {maid_name}, {salary_amount}, {due_date} B. Notification & Workflow Engine (Backend) - Integrates with WhatsApp API and email services - Sends text and TTS‑generated voice messages - Event‑based and scheduled workflow triggers - Logs every notification, delivery, and error state - Tracks workflow progress for each user C. AI Reply Brain – Intelligent Response Engine - Handles all inbound text and voice replies - Converts voice replies via ASR into text Detects user language and responds in the same language - Classifies intent: completion, confusion, insurance queries, UPI questions, Smart Backup requests, opt‑out etc. - Sentiment detection to identify confusion or frustration - Response strategy: • Next‑step explanations for onboarding • Shortened guidance if user expresses confusion • Human escalation when needed • Workflow progression updates when user completes a step D. TTS + ASR Integrations - TTS to generate voice messages in Kannada, Hindi, Nepali, and English - ASR to convert voice replies into text for understanding - Students may use open‑source models or simulate via mock services 3. Data Model Key tables include: - users - workflows - workflow_instances - notifications - templates - conversations - intents 4. Concrete Deliverables A. Functional System - Dashboard with user view and workflow status - Outbound engine (WhatsApp, voice, email) - Inbound webhook for WhatsApp replies (text and audio) - Intent detection and reply generation - Multi‑step onboarding workflows B. AI Layer - Intent detection - Language identification - Sentiment tagging - Policy rules for response generation C. Documentation & UX Artefacts - Interaction flow diagrams for onboarding, salary reminders, documents - README with setup steps - Example message‑response transcripts - Demo video (recommended) merko ye project samjha nahi tu samjha na
